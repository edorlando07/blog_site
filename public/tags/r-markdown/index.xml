      <description>Author: Ed Orlando
IntroductionExpected values can be a little tricky to understand the first time around. Using some simple and more advanced examples, this article will help you understand the mystery behind Expected Values. We will specifically answer the following questions with the help of R:
Q1: How much do I gain - or lose - on average, if I repeatedly play a given gambling game?
Q2: How much can I expect to gain - or lose - by making a certain bet?</description>
