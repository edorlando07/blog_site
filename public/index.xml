      <description>Author: Ed Orlando
IntroductionExpected values can be a little tricky to understand the first time around. Using some simple and more advanced examples, this article will help you understand the mystery behind Expected Values. We will specifically answer the following questions with the help of R:
Q1: How much do I gain - or lose - on average, if I repeatedly play a given gambling game?
Q2: How much can I expect to gain - or lose - by making a certain bet?</description>

      <description>Author: Ed Orlando
Introduction &amp;amp; Problem StatementCalculating sample sizes while accounting for power is fairly straight-forward if you have all the required inputs. Many universities have online calculators that help you determine the appropriate sample size. The variables needed to calculate the sample size while accounting for power are listed below. This article will utilize Cohen’s d calculations in the examples presented. If you are unfamiliar with any of the terms below, please click on any of the symbols for more information.</description>

      <guid>/2020/06/15/website-time-series-anomaly-detection/</guid>
      <description>Written by: Ed Orlando, Data ScientistProject DescriptionAnomaly detection can be valuable in many ways. For example, anomalies can be used to detect fraud, better understand system health monitoring, or help data engineers identify spikes in website traffic. It can also be used to remove extreme outliers from datasets before modeling.
In this project, webpage traffic outliers were identified that utilized data from the calendar year 2016. The project focused on popular United States sports, entertainment, and political events and people.</description>

      <guid>/2020/06/03/predicting-employee-attrition/</guid>
      <description>Written by: Ed Orlando, Data ScientistProject DescriptionReducing turnover in an organization is vital. Using a fabricated data set, this project utilized advanced machine learning methods that accurately predicted which employees have a higher or lesser likelihood to leave. This project also displayed which key features influenced Employee Attrition at both the macro level as well as at the individual employee level.AcknowledgementI want to thank and give credit to Matt Dancho, CEO and Founder of Business Science University.</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>
      <link>/2016/12/30/a-plain-markdown-post/</link>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>
