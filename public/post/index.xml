Introduction &amp;amp; Problem StatementWe have all been there. We are at the end of a semester in school and the only thing left to do is take that dreaded final exam. If you were like me, you wanted to know what minimum score you needed on the final exam to get a certain overall grade.
In this article, we will solve this very straightforward optimization problem programmatically using R’s ROI package.</description>

      <description>Author: Ed Orlando
IntroductionBootstrapping is a simple, yet powerful method that helps you estimate confidence intervals that can be used to enhance your data analysis. Although there are many other ways to calculate confidence intervals for data sets, this article focuses solely on bootstrapping methods.
According to Wikipedia, “bootstrapping is any test or metric that uses random sampling with replacement, and falls under the broader class of resampling methods.</description>

      <description>Author: Ed Orlando
IntroductionExpected values can be a little tricky to understand the first time around. Using some simple and more advanced examples, this article will help you understand the mystery behind Expected Values. We will specifically answer the following questions with the help of R:
Q1: How much do I gain - or lose - on average, if I repeatedly play a given gambling game?
Q2: How much can I expect to gain - or lose - by making a certain bet?</description>

      <description>Author: Ed Orlando
Introduction &amp;amp; Problem StatementCalculating sample sizes while accounting for power is fairly straight-forward if you have all the required inputs. Many universities have online calculators that help you determine the appropriate sample size. The variables needed to calculate the sample size while accounting for power are listed below. This article will utilize Cohen’s d calculations in the examples presented. If you are unfamiliar with any of the terms below, please click on any of the symbols for more information.</description>

      <title>Website Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>/2020/06/15/website-time-series-anomaly-detection/</link>

      <guid>/2020/06/15/website-time-series-anomaly-detection/</guid>
      <description>Written by: Ed Orlando, Data ScientistProject DescriptionAnomaly detection can be valuable in many ways. For example, anomalies can be used to detect fraud, better understand system health monitoring, or help data engineers identify spikes in website traffic. It can also be used to remove extreme outliers from datasets before modeling.
In this project, webpage traffic outliers were identified that utilized data from the calendar year 2016. The project focused on popular United States sports, entertainment, and political events and people.</description>

      <guid>/2020/06/03/predicting-employee-attrition/</guid>
      <description>Written by: Ed Orlando, Data ScientistProject DescriptionReducing turnover in an organization is vital. Using a fabricated data set, this project utilized advanced machine learning methods that accurately predicted which employees have a higher or lesser likelihood to leave. This project also displayed which key features influenced Employee Attrition at both the macro level as well as at the individual employee level.AcknowledgementI want to thank and give credit to Matt Dancho, CEO and Founder of Business Science University.</description>
